# BRAIN-TUMOR-DETECTION-
This project proposes two different methodologies to segment 
a tumor from an MRI image and determine the type of 
tumor. For this one segmentation and one clustering 
techniques have been implemented. Each MRI image is 
P a g e | 4
passed through an imaging chain where the image is 
preprocessed to remove noise and is further enhanced to 
improve the contrast of the image.
